This simple module makes it easy to include the Typekit library on your site. You will have to have an account at Typekit (http://typekit.com/).


Installation
==================
* Regular module installation process.
* Go to admin/config/user-interface/typekit to put in your "key"
  and determine how you want Typekit to show up.


Status
==================
This module is being deprecated (phased out) for the
more robust and flexible module @font-your-face.  There
will not be an upgrade path, so please consider using
the other module first if you are building a site from
scratch.  See:
